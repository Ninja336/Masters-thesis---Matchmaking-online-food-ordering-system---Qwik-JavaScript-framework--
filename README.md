# Master's thesis - Matchmaking online food ordering system - Qwik (JavaScript framework)

Thesis Project: Food Ordering Website Using MEN Stack and Qwik
For my thesis, I developed a full-featured food ordering website designed to streamline and modernize the experience of browsing, ordering, and managing food orders online. This platform integrates the MEN (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js) stack with Qwik, an innovative JavaScript framework that enhances web performance and user interaction. The primary objective of this thesis project was to develop a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly food ordering website

Qwik Framework: Qwik is a modern JavaScript framework designed for delivering instant-loading web apps. It focuses on resumability and fine-grained lazy loading, which significantly enhances user experience. 

Why Qwik?
Integrating Qwik was pivotal for this project due to its performance-driven design. Traditional JavaScript frameworks can cause delays by loading unnecessary components or scripts. Qwik, on the other hand, delays JavaScript execution until the client actually interacts with a specific part of the page, enhancing load time and reducing memory consumption. This aligns perfectly with the needs of a food ordering website, where speed and efficiency are critical for retaining users and ensuring smooth browsing and ordering experiences.

Conclusion:
This thesis project demonstrates how combining the MEN stack with Qwik can create a high-performance, scalable web application tailored for modern e-commerce needs. This integration not only provides a practical solution for food ordering but also showcases the potential of emerging web frameworks like Qwik in improving user experience and application performance.
